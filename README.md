# NTU What To Eat 🍽️

Discover your next meal at NTU! This website helps you filter and find restaurants around NTU based on type, price range, location, and whether they are currently open. You can also let the site decide for you with a random restaurant suggestion.

The project is live at: [NTU What To Eat](https://hypersoweak.github.io/ntu-what-to-eat)

## Features 🚀

NTU What To Eat allows you to filter restaurants by type (such as breakfast, lunch, dinner, or night snack), price range, and specific locations around NTU, including 校內, 118巷, 公館, and 溫州街. You can also filter by restaurants currently open based on their operating hours. Additionally, the app lets you sort restaurants by rating or price to refine your search, and if you're feeling indecisive, the "幫我選" button randomly picks a restaurant from your filtered results.
